This application will ask a user to input a link to a movie and a number X (for efficiency purposes it is recommended to use X <= 10), and in return they will be given the top X movies related to this movie, sorted by relevance using a customized metric.

To use this tool, run python3 crawler.py X LINK, where X is the number of desired results, and LINK is a link to an IMDB movie page (e.g https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/?ref_=chtmvm_t_100).
